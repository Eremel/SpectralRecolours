Define your new colour palette in `main.lua`.
To create your palette, use the aseprite spectral image provided and load the spectral palette.
Change the colours you want to change then save the palette as a `.hex` file. This will export the hex values in the correct order ready to put in the array in game.
Change `G.selected_spectral_colour = test_colour` to be your new palette.
